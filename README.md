# EXERCISM
[My Profile at Exercism](https://exercism.org/profiles/Matheusleal-8513)

This repository was created to save all my challenges from [Exercism](https://exercism.org/) platform, 

It's organized by branch, so each branch is a language witch I used to solve the challeges, but the main branch will have all implementations.<br/>
It's started as a F# repository to create a code base for study and quick reference for algs. <br/>
But I decided to continue <s>after finish all F# challenges</s> implementing with another languages I chose to study.
